Bingham Sunday Running Club on tour! We're pushing ourselves to try a 7-miler (11.25km), but still not take it too seriously. A sensational course linking Burghley and Stamford, with incredible access to the private areas of the Burghley estate, a traffic free High street St Martins and a course that explores countless beautiful and unique locations.
