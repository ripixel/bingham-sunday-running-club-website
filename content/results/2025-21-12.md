What a day we had getting excited about Father Christmas coming down the chimney soon! Elves, Trees, and even Santa himself turned up! Roll on next year - we hope to see many more outfits (mainly so James and Dean aren't alone in sweating more than those Reindeer must be pulling that sleigh around all day).
