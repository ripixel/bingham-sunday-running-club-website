  Get your red-and-green on, and get into the Christmas spirit! We're going big
  for this one, so dress up as Christmassy as you dare! There's the promise of
  at least one Christmas Tree and one Santa, and both will be blaring out
  Christmas tunes from speakers. Come and be merry! Usual place, usual time.

What a day we had getting excited about Father Christmas coming down the chimney soon! Elves, Trees, and even Santa himself turned up! Roll on next year - we hope to see many more outfits (mainly so James and Dean aren't alone in sweating more than those Reindeer must be pulling that sleigh around all day).
