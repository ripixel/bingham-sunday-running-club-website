  Bingham Sunday Running Club on tour! We're pushing ourselves to try a 7-miler
  (11.25km), but still not take it too seriously. A sensational course linking
  Burghley and Stamford, with incredible access to the private areas of the
  Burghley estate, a traffic free High street St Martins and a course that
  explores countless beautiful and unique locations.
location: 'Burghley House, Stamford'
